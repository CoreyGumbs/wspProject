		<p>It's just a moment in time - just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.</p>
		<p>But it's a connection.</p>
		<p>We make sure everything we do honors that connection - from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities <a href="#">to do business responsibly.</a></p>
		<p>From <a href="#">our beginnings</a> as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we've been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.</p>

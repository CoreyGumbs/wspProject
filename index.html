							<h1>Corey Gumbs</h1>
							<hr>
							<p>I am currently enrolled as a student at Full Sail University in the Web Design and Development B.S. program. My targeted graduation date is August 2016.</p>
							<p>My programming and design experience is rather limited. I am self-taught in HTML and wasn't that great with it. I attempted to build my own websites back in 2000 and have had an interest in this field ever since. After failing to learn on my own and several failed internet based businesses, I decided that it would be best to enroll in school. However, I dragged my feet on the idea until I tore my rotator on the job in 2013. I knew it was time for a career change, so I enrolled.  Now I am here and enjoying everything I have learned. My goal is to start my own app and software development company. </p>

				<h1>Header</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/header.png">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>IT professionals that work on equipment components such as servers, main frames, etc.  Network designers, or IT managers looking for the right system for their clients. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>To establish their brand via a prominent company logo that blends into the navigation as well links to their social media networks.  To establish clear options for users to navigate through the site to find the product(s) or information in making a proper decision for him or her.  </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>The layout and purpose is clear on this header. Each navigation section is clear and does not leave to question where it leads.  Spacing is utilized well so that everything isn’t muddled and illegible. I think color palate could be changed a little bit.  The heavy use of the greys gives not only the header, but also the entire site a dreary feeling. It doesn’t make me excited to be on the site or persuade me to use their services/products offered.  I think the color scheme is in line with the overall site,  I just think that maybe using them differently may give it a little more excitement.  The typeface of the navigation gives a “computer”/technological feel to it, which works but may be a little gimmicky for serious business/decisions makers. </p>

				<h1>CTA</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/twitterCTA.png">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>I believe the target is the 15-35 year old audience of social media users whom like to follow their friends, favorite industry/entertainment professionals, and get information across the world. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>Twitter took a different approach to their design of their home/landing page.  Rather than the typical design of Header > Navigation > CTA; Twitter chose to use the CTA as the first things a user sees rather than a header/navigation section. This gave me the impression that they want the experience of the user to be simple, and straight to the point. Right under the CTA is a search section to allow visitors to look for what they want. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>I like the fact that Twitter found away to merge its brand color of blue with a gradient to green. Blue signifies trust and green signifies growth or balance; which actually symbolize Twitters dominance and importance over the few years.  I also like how the CTA is simple in regards to instructions to the user. It is clear and concise and does not leave any mistakes or assumptions of what they want the user to do via their homepage.  </p>

				<h1>Features</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/spotify.jpg" height="527" width="800">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>The target is music enthusiast or fans that are between the ages of 15-40. Student and/or working professionals who like to listen to music on their mobile devices or computers. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>To get new users to sign up for one of two service options offered by the company. The product/service feature is clear on listing the differences between the two in regards to benefits to the user.  It also benefits the user's need to get started on the right plan for them through its clear listing of service options available. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>Sometimes short and sweet is the best way to get a message across. The designers didn't use fancy or colorful graphics to entice membership. The simple use of white space with 2 major colors is effective.  I particularly like the use of the black vs. green. The black is simple/plain; it doesn't do much in invoking an emotional response. It almost screams this option is boring. The green on the other hand makes you feel like this is the best option (especially since all the options are listed). It give you the feeling of moving forward, this is the most exciting way to enjoy the service. Green also the subconscious meaning of "go" for many people, especially if they are drivers.  So it creates an almost subconscious reaction to click the Go Premium button.  However, for me the green color was a little stressful on the eyes. I may have gone with something slightly darker. </p>

				<h1>About Page</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/starbucks.jpg">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>Customers who want to learn more about the Starbucks Company. Investors who are looking for company information in helping them learn more about the company and its performance. Media or news agencies looking for press or company information for press releases, news, etc.  </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>The Starbuck's about us page actually series as a portal or hub for information on the company.  Here you find links both in a navigational design as well with in the text that leads you to a particular part of the company's website. From a user point of view, I can find exactly what I am looking for without having to go through various other pages to find it. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>The about us page gives visitors and idea of their mission and the experience the company is trying to offer. Design wise it uses a lot of space and white areas to keep the page open and not convoluted with too much information. The use of links to direct users to more specified information is a good choice. I like it because I can search for what I am looking for rather than comb through a ton of non-relevant information. The color scheme stays in relation to the company's brand colors. I expected it to be a little better than what it was.  The about us navigation section stands out but I think a little more creative effort could have been used to highlight this important section. The black box background doesn't seem to fit in the overall design. </p>

				<h1>Log In Page</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/tumblerlogin.jpg">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>The Tumblr login page targets several types of people. First it targets the users of the sight. Secondly, it targets new users.  Lastly, it targets both these groups with the offering of its app on several mobile platforms.  As far as demographics, it targets people who are looking to create a blog for things such as their hobbies, business, educational or informative sites, or any other topic someone may feel they want to add. Considering it is a blog, I will say its ideal target is people who are educated (at least a 12 grade education) and tech savvy.   </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>Tumblr seeks to make access to its site as simple as possible for users.  It has a centered, large login form that only requires an email and password of the account user. Tumblr also seeks to kill several birds with one stone in one location. They have a button for new users to sign up and icons directing users/new users to their apps on the Android or IOS platforms.  This meets the user's needs by keeping various tasks on one page with out forcing them to navigate through unnecessary pages or information. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>Tumblr's login page is simple to use and self-explanatory. I expect that users have no trouble navigating or logging into their accounts. It's use of member's pictures that are random with every refresh gives it a different feel every time you go to the login page. I think this helps with potential new users to see how people are using the Tumblr platform.  As for layout/structure, it is pretty straightforward. You have the Tumblr logo and login form centered in large format. This keeps the focus on the intention of the page.  You have the sign up button in the upper right hand corner that is noticeable but not prominent. There is no color scheme or palate as the login page takes on the characteristics of the randomized background pictures.  However, they work with the stationary white logo and blue login button. This consistency ensures there is never any confusion for users even as the background changes. </p>

				<h1>Contact Page</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/contact1.jpg" height="391" width="800">
				<img src="images/contact2.jpg" height="308" width="800">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>This particular contact form targets are people looking for the closest location of the restaurant and/or other locations the restaurant may have. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>The client's goal seeks to give as much information to its customer base. They seek to show locations via a map as well as through the addresses of their various locations.  The inclusion of a customer form allows access for users to send a message via the website should they feel the need to at that moment.  From a user perspective, the site gives a lot of information to help me be able to find what I am looking for. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>The design of this contact form is nothing special to me. I think it gets the job done. You have the layout of the various locations that makes finding their contact information easy and simple to find.  The contact form is rather large at the bottom and I feel that it was designed that way as space filler. I feel like the designer didn’t like having open space and filled it with the contact form. I think for functionality and organizational purposes, I would have added an option or drop down of what topic the person was contacting the client for. The colors and fonts are in line with the theme of the website and keep the continuity going. The brown does not clash with the wood grain background image and gives the site a warm feeling.  I did not like the large map at the top of the page. I think a smaller one would still have the same effectiveness. I think the location and contact information of the restaurants would be more of an emphasis of the user than seeing a large map being displayed.</p>

				<h1>Footer</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/starfooter.jpg" height="314" width="800">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>The target audience would be anyone looking for more spefic information on the Starbucks company. Though it has sections for social media and members, that are also found through out the site, I would think that the 3 main groups that would utilize the footer would be perspective investors, brokers, companies looking to invest in startbucks; people looking for or interested in employment with Starbucks; and/or business owners/managers looking to use Starbucks in their business models or in a partnership in some form or fashion. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>The client's goal is to relay important information about the company and its website in a concise and clear manner. They want to make accessibility easy and simple for users.  It meets the user's needs through clearly designed sections with links to pertinent information to the user. This helps make navigation easy and faster for users.  Also things such as the policies etc. make transparency easier for the user as well. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>TThere is nothing spectacular about the design of the footer and my personal opinion is that there shouldn't be.   I think it serves its purpose and does it well. All-important sections are clearly labeled with links to related information/pages in the site.  The typeface is legible and clear. I think the spacing between the itemized links helps increase their legibility, especially for people like me with poor eye sight.  The color between background and text works well and doesn't cause strain to my eyes.</p>

				<h1>Gallery</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/flkr1.jpg" height="418" width="800">
				<img src="images/flkr2.jpg" height="421" width="800">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>The main target audience would be amateur and professional photographers.  The other audience targets would be people who like to look at photographs as a hobby, artist looking for common licensed photos to use in their works,  and someone looking for an online cloud to store their images on and display to friends and family.</p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>The client's goal is to display photographs stored by users to showcase to those who click their explore option on the site. Its goal is to show wonderfully produced pictures to entice people to use their service to store and showcase their photographs on. The client needs an organized yet creative format that allows pictures of various sizes and shapes to flow together in a cohesive manner for display on there explore page.  User needs would be a page that loads quickly and remains organized at all times. Also having a format that displays multiple images at once keeps the user from having to click through to other pictures. This allows them to select only what they want to see while passing over other pictures that may not be of interest. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>The flkr explore gallery performs exactly as it was designed to, a showcase of user images for people to view.  The design of the page uses a grid system that appears to be randomized in regards to how many images are shown per row.  Because the pictures contain so many different color elements, I like the idea of a simple black fixed header and greyish background. These color schemes help create an emphasis on the pictures while complimenting the many colors you find in the pictures. They aren't over powering nor cause any eyestrain for me.  The various sizes of pictures being displayed within the grid keep it them fresh and the user engaged.  It can make you feel like you have ADD, but it works. I also like the infinite scrolling aspect of the page. </p>

				<h1>Search</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/bingsearch.jpg" height="378" width="800" alt="">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>Bing's target audience would be people looking to do research, or information on a particular subject of interest. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>The client's goal is to make the search from information as precise and as easy for the user as possible. The client also wants to ensure that information is accurate and as close to the user's criteria as possible. The user needs a simple web site that allows them to enter and find the information they are looking for in as little steps as possible. They are looking for a process that doesn't require a lot of time and energy. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>Unlike its counterpart Google, Bing.com utilizes a lot of interactivity on its main search page while not loosing focus on the search form.  The search form is large as well as centrally located with no other elements near it.  The background picture elements help to make the page a little more exciting that a simple white background and seems to work with the search form. These backgrounds give the site a plethora of color options rather than sticking to just one color palate theme.  You have the header that helps offer categories for searches. This offers users more targeted searches and precise results.  The "footer" showcase current trending news on the Internet from popular searches.  This site's design gives it a better feel than Google's brand. It says, we are more "hip", more original, more willing to change. </p>

				<h1>Pricing Section</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="images/pricing.jpg" height="256" width="800">
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Target Audience:</p>
				<p>The target audience would be users who are looking to use the website's service and needs to find the right option that fits their particular budget.	</p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Client Goals/User Needs:</p>
				<p>The client needs to convey to its users the various benefits of each individual pricing package. The client also wants the user to make the best economical decision so that they maintain their subscription to the website on a long-term basis. The user needs the website to be clear on what services/items will be available to them at each particular price point/subscription.   The user needs to trust they are getting the value they seek from the money they are spending with the client. </p>
				<p class="paragraphTitle">Critique:</p>
				<p>This particular design caught my attention on the first glance. I really liked how the colors worked together.  Behind part of the options is a rotating banner and with each rotation of color, the pricing section color selection flowed with them.  I also like how each individual section had a specific color rather than grouped together by the same or similar colors. The current color scheme works in regards to the overall theme of the site. What really drew my attention was the Pricing area  and the packaging headers. I like how they worked together. The larger font type for the pricing and the headings helped emphasis the importance of information for me. I correlated the heading and pricing together before actually looking at the list where the benefits or product options went. It is a clean design and the use of various typeface sizes and spacing helps to bring home the importance of the pricing section. </p>
